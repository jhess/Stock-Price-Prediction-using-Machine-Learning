# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock Price Prediction from the S&amp;P500 using Machine Learning

The project aims to predict stocks that will outperform the S&amp;P500, using fundamental data as labels, or indepedent variables, and stock price performance relative to the S&amp;P500, using historical stock and S&amp;P500 price data, as the predictor/labels, or dependent variable.

This project is based on Sentdex's Intro to Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Python tutorial, as well as where he graciously provides the fundamental data from the Keystats directory. It has many improvements as well as overall being different, but uses some of his core work.
